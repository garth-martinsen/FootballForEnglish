0em = left-most edge of field.
15em= 25 meters from left edge of field.
31em = mid-field
47em = 25 meters from right edge of field.
62.5em = right edge of field
5em = top of field:
29.5em = bottom of field
17em = mid-field

so center of field is at 31em, 17em.

the style of the ball image must be:
{
  position:relative;
  display:block;
  top: 17em;
  left: one of {0, 15, 31, 47, 62}em;// depending on position of the ball.
}

//Use a <%=bp%> in the style to shift the ball from the server.
Note: I have found it easier to use px in lieu of em. close to 0, 250, 500, 750, 1000 px.
